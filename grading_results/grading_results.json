          "deductions": 0.5,
          "reasons": "While the student correctly identifies the need for a /60 prefix length for 100 subnets within a /48 block, they don't explicitly calculate the number of available addresses per subnet. The answer should have shown 2^12-2=4094 addresses (since /60 leaves 12 bits for host addresses)."
        },
        "IPv6 Address Compression": {
          "deductions": 0.5,
          "reasons": "The student correctly compresses the address but the explanation of rules is somewhat lacking in detail.  More precision regarding leading zeros and consecutive zero group replacement is needed."
        },
        "Hierarchical IP Design": {
          "deductions": 1,
          "reasons": "The submission lacks sufficient detail in describing a hierarchical IP addressing scheme for both IPv4 and IPv6. The answer needs a more structured approach, such as illustrating subnet assignments to regional offices with CIDR notation.  A diagram is helpful."
        },
        "IPv4 Address Conservation": {
          "deductions": 0,
          "reasons": "The student correctly calculates the subnet mask, number of subnets, and the first two subnet's network and broadcast addresses."
        },
        "IPv6 Address Aggregation": {
          "deductions": 0.5,
          "reasons": "The student's response is a bit vague and needs more concrete detail on how many bits to allocate per customer, calculations backing up the chosen prefix length and addressing efficient aggregation to minimize routing table size."
        },
        "IPv4 Address Calculations": {
          "deductions": 0.25,
          "reasons": "The student correctly calculates the broadcast address but omits the calculations and explanation for the number of valid hosts and the first and last usable addresses."
        },
        "Subnet Mask Role and Calculations": {
          "deductions": 0.5,
          "reasons": "The explanation of the subnet mask's role is adequate, but the calculations for subnets, hosts, and broadcast addresses for the given subnet mask are missing.  The student should show the work."

Focus on providing complete, well-explained answers, showing your work where calculations are involved.  Diagrams can significantly improve the clarity of answers, especially for hierarchical network design.  Pay close attention to the specific requirements of each question and ensure you fully address all aspects of the prompt."

        "Subnetting and Address Allocation": {
          "deductions": 0.75,
          "reasons": "While the student correctly identifies the need for 7 additional bits for 100 subnets, the calculation of the first and last IP addresses of the first subnet in IPv6 is flawed.  The representation is incorrect; it should reflect the use of a /55 prefix. The final addresses provided seem to be randomly generated. Using /55 will only provide 64 addresses, not 2^73. There is a misunderstanding of the IPv6 addressing scheme and its limitations. A complete rewrite is needed.  "

          "deductions": 1.0,
          "reasons": "The student's approach lacks detail and a clear hierarchical structure.  The use of /18 subnets is mentioned, but no concrete addressing plan is presented.  The explanation of routing optimization is vague. More details on how IPv4 and IPv6 will work together are needed.  It misses the diagram suggested in the answer key, which could provide crucial clarity. The student suggests private IP addresses, but does not expand on the choice of private address space."

        "IPv6 Address Aggregation": {
          "deductions": 0.5,
          "reasons": "The calculation for the number of bits needed (13) is correct, but the selection of a /45 prefix for customer networks is not optimally efficient. Using a /48 would allow for more addresses per customer and provide additional address space for growth and flexibility. The chosen method does not give the required 5000 networks and therefore isn't optimized."

          "deductions": 0.25,
          "reasons": "The binary conversion steps displayed are correct for the given example. However, there are no other address calculations given that this section requires (network address, broadcast address, number of valid hosts, and first/last usable addresses for a given IP range)."

      "grading_feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of many networking concepts, particularly IPv4 subnetting and supernetting. However, there are areas where the understanding is incomplete or where the application of concepts to specific IPv6 scenarios requires further attention.  The student struggles with more complex IPv6 topics like prefix length calculations for large-scale network designs and representing IPv6 addresses properly.  Focus on improving your understanding of IPv6 addressing, including the complexities of subnet masks and prefix lengths for large networks, and ensure a rigorous and detailed approach when presenting your solutions, including diagrams and clear explanations where needed."
