      "mistakes": {
        "Subnetting and Address Allocation": {
          "deductions": 0.5,
          "reasons": "While the student correctly determined the need for a /60 prefix (which, while correct, will only provide 64 subnets, not 100 as requested), they did not calculate the first and last addresses of the first subnet correctly within the given IPv6 address block.  They likely need to work on their IPv6 addressing skills."
        },
        "IPv6 Address Compression": {
          "deductions": 0,
          "reasons": "Correctly compressed the address and explained the rules."
        },
        "Hierarchical IP Design": {
          "deductions": 1,
          "reasons": "The student's response lacks sufficient detail and justification for both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes.  They should explain their choices of prefix lengths and how they ensure sufficient addresses for each region, scalability, and optimized routing. The design lacks the specifics and clarity required for full credit."
        },
        "IPv4 Address Conservation": {
          "deductions": 0.5,
          "reasons": "Minor error in the calculation of network and/or broadcast addresses for the subnets. The student understood the subnet mask calculation and the number of resulting subnets but made a small calculation mistake in translating this to addresses. This may have stemmed from a misunderstanding of how network and broadcast addresses work."
        },
        "IPv6 Address Aggregation": {
          "deductions": 0.5,
          "reasons": "The explanation for efficient aggregation and minimizing routing table size could be more detailed and precise.  While the prefix length may be correct, justification of the choice is too brief.  The answer shows correct understanding of the process but lacks the detail and clarity for full points."
        },

          "deductions": 0,
          "reasons": "Correct and complete explanation."

          "deductions": 0,
          "reasons": "All calculations are correct."
        },
        "Subnet Mask Role and Calculations": {
          "deductions": 0,
          "reasons": "Correct explanation and calculation"
        },
        "Supernetting": {
          "deductions": 0,
          "reasons": "Correct aggregation. If Set 2 existed, its grade would be determined based on the same standards."

          "deductions": 0,
          "reasons": "Correct explanation."

        "Distance-Vector vs. Link-State Routing Protocols": {
          "deductions": 0.5,
          "reasons": "While the key differences are mentioned, the examples provided lack sufficient detail or are not entirely accurate.  Better examples of RIP and OSPF (or similar) would improve this section."
        },
        "Network Delay vs. Bandwidth": {
          "deductions": 0,
          "reasons": "Clear and correct explanation of impact and differences."

      "grading_feedback": "Mateen, your submission demonstrates a good understanding of many networking concepts.  However, you need to pay closer attention to detail, especially in your calculations and justifications.  For example, in the subnetting and hierarchical IP design sections, your answers were partially correct but lacked the necessary depth and precision.  Work on refining your calculations, clearly articulating your reasoning and providing specific examples. You also need to practice more with IPv6 addresses to improve the accuracy of your answers and enhance your understanding.  Review the feedback provided for each section, and focus on improving your clarity and precision in explaining your answers.  Remember to show your work, as this helps demonstrate your understanding even if the final answer is not entirely correct. Paying more attention to the specific requirements of each question will significantly improve your scores in future assignments."

      "mistakes": {
        "Subnetting and Address Allocation": {
          "deductions": 1.5,
          "reasons": "Incorrect prefix length calculation for IPv6.  The student adds 7 bits to the /48, resulting in /55, which is not correct.  The calculation should consider the 16-bit blocks in IPv6.  The representation of the last address is also incorrect. It should be calculated based on the subnet mask and not a random string of characters."
        },
        "IPv6 Address Compression": {
          "deductions": 0.5,
          "reasons": "While the compression is correct, the explanation is insufficient.  The student should explicitly mention the rules of replacing consecutive zero segments with '::' and only using one '::'."
        },
        "Hierarchical IP Design": {
          "deductions": 1,
          "reasons": "The student's design lacks detail and only addresses IPv4. The plan isn't sufficiently explained or justified, not giving justification on subnet size and address count. A more detailed hierarchical design for both IPv4 and IPv6 (including subnet mask choices) is expected for full credit."
        },
        "IPv4 Address Conservation": {
          "deductions": 0.5,
          "reasons": "Minor errors in subnet calculations.  While the basic concept is correct, precision in determining the number of usable addresses and broadcast address calculation is lacking. The student incorrectly states that 52 addresses are needed, while actually only 50+2 = 52, and should have calculated subnet from there."
        },
        "IPv6 Address Aggregation": {
          "deductions": 1,
          "reasons": "The prefix length calculation for customer networks is incorrect. The explanation of efficient aggregation is also lacking detail and doesn't demonstrate the understanding of how to minimize the routing table size for the ISP."

        "Subnet Mask Role and Calculations": {
          "deductions": 0.5,
          "reasons": "The explanation of the subnet mask's role is too brief and lacks depth.  The calculations show a lack of understanding; incorrect calculation of subnets and hosts."
        },
        "Supernetting": {
          "deductions": 0.5,
          "reasons": "Minor inaccuracies in supernetting calculations."
        },
        "Routing Tables": {
          "deductions": 0.5,
          "reasons": "The explanation of the routing table's function is too superficial."
        }
      },
      "grading_feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of networking concepts but lacks precision and detail in several areas.  The student should focus on improving calculation accuracy, providing detailed explanations for each answer, and addressing all parts of each question.  The explanations provided are frequently incomplete, lacking depth, and contain factual inaccuracies.  Review the concepts of IPv6 subnetting, IPv6 address compression rules, and efficient IP address planning. Pay close attention to the differences between Classful and Classless addressing.  Practice more problems related to subnet mask calculations, supernetting, and routing table functions."
